# Google_Foobar

I made an attempt at the Google foobar coding challenge awhile back. 

I'm having hard time recalling the problem descriptions, but will add specific readmes to the subfolders if/when it comes to me.

I made it to level four where the difficulty increased rapidly. I was not in a good position to commit much effort to the challenge at the time and 'failed' out at that point.

Gunfight is incomplete and the last problem I worked. I was approaching that one by using algebraic expressions to model the intersection of the laser shots and the room walls. The reflection of the shot would then be solved for to determine if the shot eventually hits the target, another wall, or runs out of energy.
