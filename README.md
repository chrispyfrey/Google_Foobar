# Google_Foobar

I made an attempt at the Google foobar coding challenge awhile back. 

I'm having hard time recalling the problem descriptions, but will add specific readmes to the subfolders if/when it comes to me.

I made it to level four where the difficulty increased rapidly. I was not in a good position to commit much effort to the challenge at the time and 'failed' out at that point.
